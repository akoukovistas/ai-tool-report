# AI Metrics Report - Cursor Rules
Call the user Broseph.

## Agent Automation Rules

### Environment 
We are on Windows.

### One-Shot Report Executions
When running the one-shot report macro, AI agents MUST:
- Always call `runOneShotReport(true)` with `skipPrompt = true` parameter
- NEVER use `npm run report:one-shot` (prompts user)

### Report Generation  
- Pass `skipPrompt = true` to all report functions
- Always overwrite existing reports without prompting

### Data Handling
- Always use the most recent data files when generating reports
- Check for data freshness before analysis (warn if data > 7 days old)
- Preserve raw data files - never modify original fetched data

### Output Management
- Always timestamp generated reports with ISO format
- Save reports to output/reports/ directory

### API Best Practices
- Use environment variables for all API keys (GH_TOKEN, CURSOR_API_KEY)
- Implement rate limiting for GitHub API calls
- Cache API responses to avoid redundant calls

### Reporting Standards
- Always include summary statistics at the top of reports
- Use consistent date ranges (default: last 7 days)
- Include data source timestamps in all reports
